VERIFIED BY VIDEO. TREVON MARTIN WAS MAKING FUN OF GEORGE. TREVON RAN AWAY LAUGHING. A TRUCK WAS SPEEDING THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. GEORGE YELLED "SLOW DOWN" AT THE TRUCK AS TREVON WAS MAKING A DIRECT COURSE FOR THE CROSSWALK WHILE LAUGHING WILDLY AND CARRYING CANDY AND SODA IN HIS HOODIE. TRAVON WAS RUNNING FOR THE SAME CROSSWALK THE TRUCK WAS SPEEDING TOWARD. GEORGE PULLED OUT HIS GUN AND THREATENED THE DRIVER. THE DRIVER SLAMMED ON HIS BREAKS. THE IMPACT OF THE TRUCK HITTING TRAVON SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT. GEORGE SHOT AT THE TRUCK IN ANGER. TREVON HAD A HOLE IN HIS CHEST FROM THE WINCH ON THE TRUCK. THE REST IS JUST POLICE CONFUSION.
